## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Software Engineer who loves solving real-world problems with code.

* Check out all my projects [here](https://github.com/tenlalong?tab=repositories).
* I work mostly on internal GitHubs, so this is where I post my passion projects.
* I hope to learn more about Cloud, CI/CD.
* I am currently learning French (pendant 7 mois). I hope to get B2 by the end of this year.
